# Social Norms and Gender

My current idea is to check whether certain anthropological characteristics of an immigrant's home country explains specific behaviours. In particular, how gender norms might influence labour and marriage market outcomes. It should also be interesting to see how these outcomes change over time and generations.

These changes can be understood as a process of assimilation.

## Roadmap

I think the way to go is as follows:

1. Check with advisor
2. Download all the data
3. Build the measure from the QJE paper
4. TBD
