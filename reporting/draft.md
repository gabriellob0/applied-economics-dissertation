# Draft

## Section 2.1 (20 marks)

> This section should focus on a discussion of the economics which lies behind the topic. It should explain relevant economic theory and discuss why the model being estimated and/or the hypotheses being tested are interesting and important. It should demonstrate a good grasp of economic theory.

There exists a large literature on decision making within households. Many relevant individual decisions and their associated outcomes are made jointly by families. These families frequently share resources, but each family member might have preferences that are misalligned.

## Section 2.2 (20 marks)

> This section should provide a literature review of previous work in the field of central article or topic question.

## Section 3.1 (20 marks)

> This section should describe the econometric tools to be used in extensions. It should explain what problem they address and why they address them, discuss the remaining limitations attached to these techniques. It is important to demonstrate a good grasp of quantitative methods theory.

I follow a split sample equivalent approach described in Feigenberg, Ost and Qureshi (20XX)

## Section 3.2 (20 marks)

> This section should present the dataset and its sources, the descriptive statistics and results from the extensions. A discussion of the results robustness and/or any limitations should also be incorporated.
