## Introduction

## Section 2.1 (20 marks)

> This section should focus on a discussion of the economics which lies behind the topic. It should explain relevant economic theory and discuss why the model being estimated and/or the hypotheses being tested are interesting and important. It should demonstrate a good grasp of economic theory.

A large portion of the economic literature has devoted its attention to decision making within households. Research has shown the importance of family to the decision making of individuals. Families frequently share resources and, consequently, make decisions on their allocation together. However, family member might have misalligned preferences.

Given the focus on gender roles within couples, the model assumes cohabiting couples of individuals with shared budgets. Decisions about labour supply are made jointly. I follow the strand of models called collective models within the literature, which are a form o cooperative bargaining model. The main assumption behind collective models are that household decisions are always Pareto efficient.

Such models highlight the importance of factors such as.

In a household with two members, utility for individual \[ i element (a, b) \]

\[ \text{U}^{i} (Q, q^a, q^b) \]

## Section 2.2 (20 marks)

> This section should provide a literature review of previous work in the field of central article or topic question.

Social norms only came to prominence within the economic literature in the early 2000s. Akerlof and Kranton (2000) was the seminal paper highlighting how considerations on norms can explain empirically observed behaviours that did not match predictions from standard household models.

Bertrand, Kamenica, and Pan (2015) demonstrated using US data the relevance of a particular gender norm. The male breadwinner norm. This norm establishes that the men are responsible for bringing money to the family while women are expected to take domestic duties. They show using us data that violating the male breadwinner norm, defined at wifes earning more than 50% of household income, has significant effects on marriages, divorces, measures of satisfactions, labour market participation rates, work hours, and household production.

The effect on household production goes...

## Section 3.1 (20 marks)

> This section should describe the econometric tools to be used in extensions. It should explain what problem they address and why they address them, discuss the remaining limitations attached to these techniques. It is important to demonstrate a good grasp of quantitative methods theory.

I follow a split sample equivalent approach described in Feigenberg, Ost and Qureshi (20XX).

\[ \text{hwork}_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{wife\_earns\_more}_{it} + \beta_2 \times \text{hisp}_{i} + \beta_3 \times (\text{wife\_earns\_more}_{it} \times \text{hisp}_{i}) + \boldsymbol{\gamma}' \times \mathbf{x}_{it} + \boldsymbol{\lambda}' \times (\mathbf{x}_{it} \times \text{hisp}_{i}) + \boldsymbol{\alpha}_{i} + \boldsymbol{\delta}_{t} + u_{it} \]


## Section 3.2 (20 marks)

> This section should present the dataset and its sources, the descriptive statistics and results from the extensions. A discussion of the results robustness and/or any limitations should also be incorporated.

> Kalmijn, Loeve, and Manting (2007) argue that the impact of relative income on dissolution differs across married and cohabiting couples.

So I restric the sample only to married couples.

> In column (3) we include a control for relativeIncomei. That is particularly important in this context because standard Beckerian forces will lead the wife to do less housework when her contribution to family income increases.
