Data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) from 1990 to 2019. The sample contains individual-level data linked over multiple years and only includes cohabiting dual-earner married couples aged between 18 and 65. Only the first chronological observation per household is included. Couples with mixed ethnic backgrounds (i.e., one Hispanic and one non-Hispanic person) are excluded. All observations where any of the regression variables are missing are also excluded (see Empirical Strategy section for details). The income share is calculated from the gross monthly income from the primary job. Density is estimated using the rddensity package with a triangular kernel.
